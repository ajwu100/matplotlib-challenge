The three observations or inferences that can be made from the data are:
1. Pymaceutical's new drug regimen, Capomulin, is the most effective in decreasing the tumor volume in comparison with the other 8 drug regimens including the Placebo.  Importantly, Capomulin is equal in efficacy as an existing drug Ramicane in controlling tumor volume.  
2. The efficacy of the Capmulin on tumor growth is independent of the gender of the mice, given that similiar proportion of female (49.3%) and male (50.7%) were used in the study.
3. Tumor volume is positively correlated with mouse weight during capomulin regimen, indicating that general weight loss may be a side effect of the capomulin in mice.
